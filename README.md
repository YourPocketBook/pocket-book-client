<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![YourPocketBook Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://yourpocketbook.uk/)

The YourPocketBook project aims to provide SJA volunteers with easy access to policies and procedures.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need node.js to build or work on this site. You can get it
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/). This has been tested using v12.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YourPocketBook/pocket-book-client.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

### Running Locally

This site is built around Create React App. This comes with a local server that will let you test the site on your own machine.

To work properly, you will need a copy of [the server](https://github.com/YourPocketBook/pocket-book-server) running on your machine as well. Don't forget to follow the setup instructions for the server.

The following command will start the test server:

```sh
npm start
```

You can run the unit tests with the command:

```sh
npm run test
```

By default, only tests that affect files that have changed but not been committed will be run. Follow the prompts to run the rest.

The latest instructions for working with Create React App are [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md), with lots of useful tips on how to set up your work environment.
