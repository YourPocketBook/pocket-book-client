## How to contribute to the Pocket Book

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead email the project lead (tony.richards@sja.org.uk).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/trichards57/pocketbook/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/trichards57/pocketbook/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **detailed description** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Pocket Book will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open an issue on GitHub, giving details of what the change will do, how fits in with the project, and
any help you need to make it happen.

Thanks!
